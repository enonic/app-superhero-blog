## Work in progress

This is still being developed and is not ready for production yet.

## Building

Gradle is required to build the project.

## Creating a site

Create a site and give it a name.

Create folders called Authors, Categories, Comments and Posts.

Create a Category and an Author content in their respective folders.

Create a Post content in the Posts folder and add the Category and Author content.

When the above steps are done, create a page template and add the 70-30 Layout.

Add the "Header" and "Posts list" parts to the left side of the layout.

Add the following parts to the right side of the layout: Search form, Recent posts, Recent comments, and Categories.

Make this page template support the Site and Landing page content type.

Create another page template called "Post show". Add the same parts except use the "Post single" part instead of the "Posts list".

Make the Post show template support the Post content type.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for this module is being created.

TODO: Write documentation and insert link

TODO: Find the CSS bug that causes the part and layout names to display wrong when you add them.

TODO: Finish the date meta data in various parts.

TODO: Finish the dynamic classes and IDs in various parts.

TODO: Create the tag cloud part

TODO: Create the Meta part with login/out and stuff.

TODO: Finish the comments part.

TODO: Make a hidden comment manager page to approve or delete comments.

TODO: Consider merging post-list and post-show into the same part. I had it this way to start with but it got quite complicated so I
separated them and now I think that maybe I should merge them back together.
